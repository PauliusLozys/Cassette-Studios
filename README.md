# Cassette-Studios game
Game made for KTU/SneakyBox using Unity engine

A spooky game set in a spooky castle that is very spooky to go into.

Spooky Castleâ„¢ is a roguelike, dungeon crawaler game that is in no way a clone of another simmilar game Rogue Legacy.

This game was made with love and "borrowed" assets.
